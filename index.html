    <p>Hello Aspirant,

        No one can ever be sure of anyone’s recommendation.
        
        SSB/AFSB is all about the test of your personality and knowledge.
        
        They always look for some qualities called Officer Like Qualities in you.
        
        Have this in my mind always. THE FIRST ATTEMPT IS ALWAYS THE BEST ATTEMPT.
        
        Whenever you are a Fresher, you always have some reasonable lenience towards you. I mean, minor mistakes like getting nervous, fumbling, at the beginning of the interview, would not be considered.
